# Shelly Device(s) Repo

## Shelly 1+ (as seen on the PCB) Plus 1 (plus one) 

In this section you will find information about the [Shelly Plus 1](https://shelly.cloud/shelly-plus-1/)

### DISCLAIMER (progress at own risk! I can't be liable for any damage you do to the board, the plastic or device overall !)

### How to open :
The Shelly 1+ is a bit tricky to open as the case seems like it is not meant to be open. 

Turn the device so that you are seeing the back of the Shelly device (you can see voltage ratings, CE mark etc.). The writing should be right side up and readable. 

This Shelly has three clips holding it in place. One in the center, one on the left and one on the right. 

We will start with the center one. You should have the reset button on your right. At the bottom there is a small notch and hole. This is where one of the plastic clip is holding on to the top cover.

Using a small screwdriver you can pry the cover open a bit. Little force is needed. You only need to move it a little bit. The rest of the case can then be opened with the use of a plastic telephone/bus card or other plastic pry tool you may have. Use it then to pry open the clips on the left and right. It should be easy once the first clip is loose.

### SPI Flash
Unlike the previous version of the Shelly 1 (switch) this new version doesn't have an SPI flash that can be read in-line.
